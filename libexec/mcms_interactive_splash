This is really just a fancy-dancy screen session.

You'll find at the bottom of your terminal that there are multiple "tabs" open.
These tabs, or regions, all exist within a single encompassing screen "session."
One of these tabs is a BASH prompt and another is HTOP, so you can monitor the
utilization of the system to which you were scheduled in real time.

Please be sure to close out of sinteractive when you're done.

Here are some useful screen commands.

Key sequence    Result
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ctrl+a ?        Display screen's command list
ctrl+a c        Create a new tab (with shell)
ctrl+a k        Close the current tab
ctrl+a n/p      Proceed to the next (n) or previous (p) tab
ctrl+a <num>    Jump to tab <num>
ctrl+a Esc      Scroll back through text in the tab (press 'q' to stop)
ctrl+a d        Detach from the session (in our case, kill sinteractive)
