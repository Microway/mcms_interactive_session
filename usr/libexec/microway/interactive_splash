This interactive session is really just a login with the GNU screen utility.

You'll find multiple "tabs" open at the bottom of your terminal window. These
tabs, or regions, all exist within a single encompassing screen "session." The
first tab lets you monitor the real-time utilization of this system. The second
is a standard Linux shell session (where you should do your work). Additional
tabs may be easily created - see the keyboard shortcuts below.

Please close this session when you're done or the scheduler will kill it. You
can see the amount of time remaining at the bottom-right of this window.


Here are some useful screen commands:

  Key combination   Result
  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Ctrl+a ?          Display screen's help page

  Ctrl+a c          Create a new tab (with bash shell)
  Ctrl+a A          Assign a new name to the current tab
  Ctrl+a k          Kill/Close the current tab

  Ctrl+a "          Show a list of all tabs
  Ctrl+a n          Switch to the next tab
  Ctrl+a p          Switch to the previous tab
  Ctrl+a <num>      Jump to tab <num>

  Ctrl+a Esc        Scroll back through text in the tab (press 'q' to stop)
  Ctrl+a d          Detach from the session (without killing any running jobs)

  (For example, hold down CTRL and tap 'a'. Then release both and press 'n')
